<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Shaoli Das, a passionate backend developer with a strong foundation in building scalable, efficient, and well-tested systems. With nearly 3 years of experience working on real-time parking automation systems across casinos, airports, and stadiums in North America, I thrive in environments that demand performance, precision, and creative problem-solving.</p>

<p>I specialize in Node.js, NestJS, MongoDB, MySQL, and have worked with cloud platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure, and various microservice architectures. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and believe that great software comes from attention to detail and clear communication within the team. From automating parking reservations to optimizing backend APIs, my focus is always on building tech that improves everyday life..</p>

<p>Beyond code, I enjoy collaborating on product ideas, solving real-world problems, and occasionally diving into frontend or DevOps tasks when needed. My goal is to continue evolving as a developer, contribute to meaningful projects, and someday build a tech-driven business of my own. Let’s connect and create something impactful!</p>
